Ok so this is the Read Me for Silly_GIF. So for those who stumble upon it the idea behind it was i simply could not find a Gif i wanted.
Nor do i like any of the Gif Websites where you can create your own so i thought to look up how to make one and that did not go well so i asked Chat GPT and here we are.
The idea from the code is the code will generate a entirely new Gif. The overall Gif i am aiming to make has the animation like the classic window logo screen savior. 
While in Caveat text style with the words 'You are amazingly silly' with that just being the start. 
Because as i was developing this i was also aiming to being able to be able to exchange the text to other stuff. 

So if you are willing to help solve the issue that would be appreicated.
